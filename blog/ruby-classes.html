  <h3>Ruby: Classes</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>February 8th, 2016</h4>
  <br>
    <p>
      In this post I'm going to discuss Ruby Classes, the importance of them, and how they you can use instances of classes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      First, what is a Ruby Class? We know Ruby is an object-oriented programmng language, but how are they created. This is where Ruby classes come into play. A Ruby Class is the blueprint in which individual objects are created.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Let's imagine a Ruby Class for a Vehicle. Within the class, we'd have to establish what the vehicle can do, what characteristics the car has, such as: horsepower, speed, wheels, etc. This will allow you to create an INSTANCE of these characteristics. We know a local variable is defined inside a method and therefore can only be used inside that method. On the other hand, Instance Variables can be used across methods on any particular instance or object. It means they change from object to object.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Usually when initializing a class or new object of that class, you then would call instance methods created in that class that can be utilized to create instances of the class and oject.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      A lot of Ruby buil-in methods come from Classes that were designed in the conception of the Ruby language. If you think about 'String', Array, Hash, etc. They all have built in methods, meaning they have their own classes with methods defined allowing us to create instances of these objects.</p>
