        <div id="blog-content">
          <p>Ever stay up late at night browsing the web and start to think about what the internet even really is? </p>
          <p>Some sort of virtual landscape where information can be stored, accessed and shared, right?</p>
          <p>The internet is a younge technology, yet it's one of the most important tools we have in today's world. Every year, engineers create more devices that work with the internet. This becomes a network of networks that expands across the globe and even into space.</p>
          <p>The easiest way to understand the internet is to think of it as a system with two parts. The first part is the hardware. The physical cables that carry the information, the routers, servers, cell phone towers, satellites, smartphones, etc.</p>
          <p>The machines that make connections are the computer, the smartphone. The machines that store the information we look for on the internet are servers.</p>
          <p>The second part of how the internet works is: Protocols. These are sets of rules that machines follow to complete tasks. This enables devices to follow the set of rules to communicate with one another. The protocols provide both the method and a common language for machines to use to transmit data.</p>
          <p>Some examples of protocols are: hypertext transfer protocol (this is what we use to view web sites through a browswer, it's what the http at the front of a web address stands for), transmission control protocol (TCP), and Internet Protocol (IP). These two are often grouped together and listed as TCP/IP.</p>
          <p>IP addresses follow internet protocol. Each device connected to the internet has an IP address. This is how one machine can find another through the massive network.</p>
          <p>When you open your browser and connect to a web site, your computer sends an electronic request over your Internet connection to your Internet service provider (ISP). The ISP routes the request to a server further up the chain on the internet. Eventually, the request will hit a domain name server (DNS). The server will look for a match for the domain name you've typed in. If it finds a match, it will direct your request to the proper server's IP address.</p>
