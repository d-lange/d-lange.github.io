How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was interesting. I think we both had similar ideas. We chose to both do our own and then talk about it. We realized the important aspects of the wireframe and worked off that which was good. Nothing too complex. The HTML page was a little different, trying different ideas, different tags, etc. We ended up making a super simple template. I'm hoping to personalize it more with CSS as we move on.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I think it's definitely helpful. Before one can develop, they need to plan and design. The wireframing process takes care of that and as a developer will feel so much better having that direction to go off of.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided a Header, a nav-bar, and a section for the blog post, and a footer were the key aspects to making the site functional.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about <article> and <section> tags as well as <header> and <footer> tags. I feel like I have a lot more to learn when it comes to the semantics.
