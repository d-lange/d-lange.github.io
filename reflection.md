###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

When doing this challenge, I learned a lot about padding, borders, and margin. I was able to utilize border and padding to create visible sections that divided my elements of the page nicely. Margin was helpful as well to make sure all the spacing around the page made sense.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Well, I didn't really use it too much, but I was able to see how the various positioning properties affected my page layout or just how I could further control the element depending on the property I set for position.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I thought that setting the borders and background-colors made it easier to visualize each part of my site. From there I was able to control the elements further in css and have them be more in the middle of the site. I'm still not feeling so confident, but the most difficulty I had was with moving things around how I wanted. I think as a beginner, seeing the borders of each "section" helped see what I had control over and where they were.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that the better the HTML is coded, the easier the CSS should be to code. Using classes and ids made it easier to target specific parts of the page. I also learned that I have a LOT more to go before I become confident and proficient in designing a webpage. I'm at the tip of the iceberg and I know the more I play with each property, the more I will truly understand its meaning.
